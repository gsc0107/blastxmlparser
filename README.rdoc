= bio-blastxmlparser

blastxmlparser aims to a fast big-data BLAST XML file parser. Rather
than loading everything in memory, XML is parsed by BLAST query. Not
only has this the advantage of low memory use, it may also be faster
when IO continues in parallel (disks read ahead). 

Please note that this is experimental software, at this stage.

== Performance

To see why libxml2 based Nokogiri is fast, see
http://www.rubyinside.com/ruby-xml-performance-benchmarks-1641.html
and http://www.xml.com/lpt/a/1703.

The parser is also designed with other optimizations in mind, such as
lazy evaluation, and parallelization. blastxmlparser is written in
Ruby and C, but can also be used without knowing Ruby.

== Install

  gem install bio-blastxmlparser

For this version the Nokogiri XML parser is required. To install it,
the libxml2 libraries and headers need to be installed first, for
example on Debian:

  apt-get install libxslt-dev libxml2-dev

for more installation on other platforms see
http://nokogiri.org/tutorials/installing_nokogiri.html.
